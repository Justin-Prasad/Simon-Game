# What is this and how do I play?
This is a simple Simon Says game crafted using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
For those unfamiliar with the game "Simon Says" on a computer, it's a game that tests your memory! (At least my rendition is :D)

To start, you will be greeted by the following image. As directed, just press any key to start the game.

The game will start by giving you a colour which you then repeat. Pretty simple right?
For every correct sequence you advance a level. Now this is the kicker. The computer only gives 1 new colour per turn, and it's up to the user to remember the sequence of colours from the previous turn(s). In case that sounds a tad bit confusing, here's an example. 

Let's create a litle scenario here for *maximum immersion*. 

You're playing the game, and having a lovely time I may add. On turn 1, the game spat out red. So you click red. Turn 2 occurs, and the game spits out yellow. You click red, then yellow, to represent the sequence of all the colours that came before your turn, which sets the new sequence as 'red, yellow'. This means that when the computer gives a new colour, you have to click red from turn 1, and yellow from turn 2. Now on to turn 3. Things are getting real now as the game spits out... green. You panick as you couldn't remember the colour from the previous turn. You click red, blue, and - BAM. The game greets you with this screen.

Better luck next time, pal. 

# Why this?
I chose to make this project because I've been accumulating an interest in web development and full stack development. This project served as a valuable stepping stone into that realm! It's helping me develop skills that I'll need on the job such as problem-solving skills in a technical capacity, coding and technical literacy, organization and documentation (in terms of code), and attention to detial for the UI to name a few. 

I'm very pleased on how this project went given the time and turmoil taken to create it. Being able to make this game has given me a lot more appreciation on the things we take for granted now such as nice User Interfaces, and the technical component needed to build and maintain a website's functionality.
